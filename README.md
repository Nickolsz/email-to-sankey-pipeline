# email-to-sankey-pipeline
This repository is for a pipeline project to automatically fetch emails, process the data, use Scikit-learns; multionminal Naive Bayes classifer to categorize the data, and then build an automatically updating job hunt sankey graph.

This project allowed me to gain expierience in creating a ETL data pipeline, as well as automating a task that typically takes up a lot of peoples time.

For the Gui I used ParthJadhav's Tkinter-Designer: https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer
